# ETD Transformer

Transform theses for ingest into Princeton long-term data repository. View documentation for:

- [Dissertations](process-dissertations.md): We get them from ProQuest and re-format them for DSpace ingest
- [Senior theses](process-theses.md): We get these from ThesisCentral and augment them (e.g., with embargo metadata)

Dev notes and installation instructions are available in the [README](https://github.com/pulibrary/etd_transformer).
