        We investigate several methods of explore-exploit decision making for the appli-cation of trash collection.  To do this, we explore the optimization of the multi-agentMulti-Armed Bandit (MAMAB) problem using the UCB1 algorithm.  We considercases of inter-agent message passing and no message passing, as well as several re-ward distributions.  We show that for fixed initial and constant rate addition rewarddistributions, performance improves as the degree of communication increases.  Wealso show that beyond a certain degree of communication, there is negligible improve-ment in system performance.  We develop a novel simulator for MAMAB problems toverify our theoretical results.  We demonstrate that our adaptation of UCB1 achievescumulative regret logarithmically with time, and is a valid approach to the trash col-lection problem.
